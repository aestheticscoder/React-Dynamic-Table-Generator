# Dynamic Table Generator with React

This project is a simple React application that generates a table dynamically based on the number entered in the input field. The table updates immediately as the number changes.

## Features

- Enter a number in the input field to generate a table with sequential numbers.
- The table updates in real-time as you type a new number.
- The table is displayed below the input field.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the application.
- CSS: Styling the user interface.
